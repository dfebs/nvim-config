# Neovim config: dfebs
This config is currenly under heavy construction. This mostly exists here so I have it and I can edit it anywhere.

## Setup
```
cd ~/.config/nvim
git clone this repo
```

## Things to consider (a sorta to-do list)

- [] Currently just doing one editor at a time. I know there's lots of ways to split them out and stuff but it will be good when to use splitting on the neovim side vs using it on the tmux side
- [] Worth eventually doing the :Tutor thing. Might learn some extra stuff.
