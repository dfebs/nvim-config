# Neovim config: dfebs
This config is currenly under heavy construction. This mostly exists here so I have it and I can edit it anywhere.

## Setup
```
cd ~/.config/nvim
git clone this repo
```

## Things to consider (a sorta to-do list)


- [ ] Find the equivalent for javascript debug terminal
- [ ] Figure out the javascript/nodejs lsp + eslint/prettier situation
- [ ] Figure out how to get telescope to NOT ignore dotfiles but still ignore gitignore stuff
- [x] Fix issue where copy/paste doesn't work on mac because I have it currently designed for wsl
- [ ] Worth eventually doing the `:Tutor` thing. Might learn some extra stuff.
- [x] Have telescope ignore stuff like node_modules and show hidden files. This goes for file search and livegrep
- [x] Figure out how to comment out selections
- [x] Figure out how to tab selections to indent everything in the selection
- [x] Look into bufferline and lualine
- [ ] Look into plugins that do code collapsing
- [ ] Spellchecking
- [ ] Undo history
- [x] (non-neovim) have tmux use ctrl+a instead of ctrl+b
- [ ] (non-neovim) Look into the ranger command line tool
- [x] (non-neovim) Look into the lazygit tool
