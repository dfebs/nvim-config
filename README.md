# Neovim config: dfebs
This config is currenly under heavy construction. This mostly exists here so I have it and I can edit it anywhere.

## Setup
```
cd ~/.config/nvim
git clone this repo
```

## Things to consider (a sorta to-do list)

- [ ] Currently just doing one editor at a time. I know there's lots of ways to split them out and stuff but it will be good when to use splitting on the neovim side vs using it on the tmux side
- [ ] Worth eventually doing the `:Tutor` thing. Might learn some extra stuff.
- [ ] Have paste-over not actually copy the thing you are pasting over
- [ ] Have telescope ignore stuff like node_modules and show hidden files. This goes for file search and livegrep
- [ ] Figure out if gitsigns has more features. It's pretty neat so far
- [ ] Figure out how to comment out selections
- [ ] Figure out how to tab selections to indent everything in the selection
- [ ] Look into bufferline and lualine
- [ ] Look into plugins that do code collapsing
- [ ] (non-neovim) have tmux use ctrl+a instead of ctrl+b
- [ ] (non-neovim) Look into the ranger command line tool
- [ ] (non-neovim) Look into the lazygit tool
